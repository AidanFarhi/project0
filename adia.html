	<p>This is Adia Gaines. She is awesome. I don't know what I would do without her. She has been with me through all the ups and downs.</p>

	<h3>Some of her favorite things</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Jesus</li>
		<li>Dancing</li>
		<li>Funny Movies</li>
		<li>Butter pecan Ice Cream</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I hope to one day be able to provide her with a house. I really love her and want to see her happy.</p>
